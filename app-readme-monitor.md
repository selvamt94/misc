Starting from version 5.4.6, NeuVector generates a secure password and stores it in the neuvector-bootstrap-secret. On first login, the default admin must retrieve the password using: 
`kubectl get secret -n {neuvector} neuvector-bootstrap-secret  -o go-template='{{ .data.bootstrapPassword | base64decode }}{{ "\n" }}'`
The password must be changed during the first login via the NeuVector UI. User should provide this admin password when deploying prometheus exporter.
