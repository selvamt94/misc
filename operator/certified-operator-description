  description: "NeuVector delivers the only cloud-native Kubernetes security platform with uncompromising end-to-end protection from DevOps vulnerability protection to automated run-time security, and featuring a true Layer 7 container firewall.\n\nThe NeuVector Operator runs  in the openshift container platform to deploy and manage the NeuVector Security cluster components. The NeuVector operator contains all necessary information to deploy NeuVector using helm charts. You simply need to install the NeuVector operator from the OpenShift embeded operator hub and create NeuVector instance. You can modify the NeuVector installation configuration by modifying yaml while creating the NeuVector instance such as imagePullSecrets, tag version, etc. Please refer to [github link](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-helm/tree/master/charts/core) for the values that can be modifed during installation. To upgrade to a newer version of NeuVector, just reapply the NeuVector instance with desired tag , which in turn pulls the specified NeuVector image tags and upgrades as per upgrade plan configured on the helm chart.  NeuVector Operator versions are tied to NeuVector product versions. Version 1.3.5 of the NeuVector Certified Operator deploys version 1.1.1 of NeuVector.\n\n**Complete below steps to Grant Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC before installation.**\n\nCreate the NeuVector namespace\n\n         oc new-project  neuvector\nLogin as system:admin account\n\n         oc login -u system:admin\n\nPrivileged SCC is added to Service Account specified in the deploment yaml by Operator version 1.3.6 and above in new deployment. In case of upgrading NeuVector Operator from previous version to 1.3.6, please delete Privileged SCC before upgrading.\n\n         oc delete rolebinding -nneuvector system:openshift:scc:privileged\n\nThe following info will be added in the Privileged SCC users:\n\n         - system:serviceaccount:neuvector:default\n\nIn OpenShift 4.6+ use the following to check:\n\n         oc get rolebinding system:openshift:scc:privileged -n neuvector -o wide\n         system:openshift:scc:privileged   ClusterRole/system:openshift:scc:privileged   9m22s                    neuvector/default\n\n\n**Add NeuVector license from NeuVector WebUI->setting**\n\n\n#Deploying the NeuVector Operator#\n\n\nPlease refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector-operator/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n"
